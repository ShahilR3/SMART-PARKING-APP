# SMART-PARKING-APP
It is very common waiting outside a parking lot and looking if any space available in
there, this overtime will be irritating and time consuming especially in traffic rich cities
like Bangalore, Delhi etc.
Everyone would have frequently experienced that they park their vehicle somewhere
beside the road and by the time they return the vehicle is gone, this would have been
the worst day for a person having plans for the day. Thus, knowing the availability of
parking space in advance would help people to plan for the same and save the time
which would have been spent in looking for a spot in the lot. The parking fee is also a
major concern of people, wherein many of them would not know the cost of parking
per hour basis and which would cause them to pay more than the actual fee for it. This
Parking Management App is a parking solution which to solve the above problems by
providing the user with the available space in the lot and calculate the amount
accurately with the parameters of entry time and exit time. It will also keep history of
all the vehicles parked at any parking spot with specific date and time
